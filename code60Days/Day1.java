LC27. Remove Element
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100
  
/* Sloution:
Use two pointer.
If fast encounters an element that needs to be removed, skip it directly, 
otherwise tell slow the pointer and let slow move forward one step.
*/ 
  
  
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;
        while (fast < nums.length) {
            if (nums[fast] != val) {
                nums[slow] = nums[fast];
                slow++;
            }
            fast++;
        }
        return slow;
    }
}

LC704:
Binary Search
Companies
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
  
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1; // 定义target在左闭右闭的区间里，[left, right]
        while (left <= right) { // 当left==right，区间[left, right]依然有效，所以用 <=
            int middle = left + ((right - left) / 2);// 防止溢出 等同于(left + right)/2
            if (nums[middle] > target) {
                right = middle - 1; // target 在左区间，所以[left, middle - 1]
            } else if (nums[middle] < target) {
                left = middle + 1; // target 在右区间，所以[middle + 1, right]
            } else { // nums[middle] == target
                return middle; // 数组中找到目标值，直接返回下标
            }
        }
        // 未找到目标值
        return -1;
    }
};
